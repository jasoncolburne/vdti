# IEL Verification — Verifier Walk

The IEL verifier walks a chain from inception to tip, validating structural integrity (SAID, prefix,
chain linkage, per-kind field rules), **threshold authority** (a threshold of members' fresh KEL
participations anchor each event, resolved down to KEL signatures), roster and threshold state
(accumulated as a delta while walking), the facet-dependent `Wit` payload (dispatched on the chain's
root), and anchor presence (the `manifest` roles per kind). It returns a verification token —
`IelVerification` — that downstream consumers hold as proof-of-verification and use to access
trusted chain data.

Unlike a KEL, an IEL event carries **no adjacent signature of its own** — it authenticates entirely
by its KEL anchors
([`../event-shape.md` §Authentication & signatures](../event-shape.md#authentication--signatures)).
So the IEL verifier's authority check is a **down-walk**: for each IEL event, resolve the member KEL
participations that anchor it, verify each anchoring KEL (its signature and tier), and count them
against the threshold the IEL event's kind requires.

This doc states the walk algorithm, the root-facet dispatch, threshold anchoring and roster
accumulation, the bounded delegation walk, the `kills[]` forward-match, the token surface, and the
federation-witnessing signals consumers read. For per-kind reference, see [`events.md`](events.md);
for chain lifecycle, [`log.md`](log.md); for merge-layer routing, [`merge.md`](merge.md); for the
cross-node correctness proof, [`reconciliation.md`](reconciliation.md).

## What verification ensures

For every event the verifier walks, it ensures:

- Events match their kind-specific schemas (required and forbidden fields per the
  [event-shape reference](../event-shape.md#iel)), including the `manifest` role allowlist read
  kind-first and the `previousSeal` presence rule (present on every sealing kind, forbidden on `Icp`
  / `Fcp` / `Ixn`).
- Serials start at 0 and increment by 1 with no gaps; the inception event has serial 0 and a valid
  prefix (re-derived from the canonical bytes with `said` / `prefix` set to the placeholder — the
  roster, threshold vector, and `nonce` all participate).
- All event prefixes match the chain's prefix; all events have valid SAIDs; events chain correctly
  via `previous`; each sealing event's `previousSeal` resolves to the prior seal (the spine).
- **Every IEL event is anchored by a threshold of members' fresh KEL participations** — the required
  count drawn from the threshold vector by the event's kind, each participation kind-strict to the
  capability the act exercises, and each anchoring KEL signature valid.
- The **root facet** (`Fcp` vs `Icp`) is established before any `Wit` payload is read, and each
  `Wit` is read under the facet-correct allowlist.
- The current roster and threshold vector are the accumulation of every delta walked (with the
  live-set cap of `MAXIMUM_ROSTER_SIZE`); every config-changing event re-checks the post-delta
  bounds.

Events are linked by their `previous` SAID; the serial in the canonical bytes makes each event's
position structurally unambiguous, and the `pins`-SAD records the members' prior KEL tips so the
IEL's `said` never depends on the anchoring events.

## Walk algorithm

The verifier processes events in a single forward pass, verifying structure, authority, and state
simultaneously. Events must arrive in canonical order
`(serial ASC, kind sort_priority ASC, said ASC)` with complete generations. A **generation** is the
set of all events at a given serial; the verifier processes events in generation order and tracks
per-branch state. A fork forks per-branch state — when a second distinct event appears at the same
serial as the first, the verifier records `divergence_ancestor` (the SAID of `v_{d-1}`) and tracks
both branches independently — the field verdict-coupled exactly as the KEL's (Forked: the first
divergence; Disputed: the earliest carrying ≥ 2 accepted sealed branches; not a recovery point on
Disputed).

### Per-event checks

For each event in the page:

```
verify_event(event):
    # 1. SAID and prefix integrity
    event.verify()  # Inception: verify both prefix and SAID; subsequent: verify SAID

    # 2. Prefix consistency
    if event.prefix != verifier.prefix:
        return Error("Prefix mismatch")

    # 3. Structure validation
    validate_structure(event)          # Required / forbidden fields per kind (event-shape)
    assert event.manifest carries only roles in allowed(event.kind, root_facet)   # read kind-first, facet-aware

    # 4. Serial + chain continuity
    if event.serial != expected_serial: return Error("Serial gap or regression")
    match event to a branch via event.previous       # else Error("Previous SAID not found")
    if event is seal-advancing and event.previousSeal != branch.last_seal:
        return Error("Spine back-link mismatch")

    # 5. Threshold authority (the down-walk)
    resolve_anchors(event)             # the member KEL participations that anchor this event
    verify_threshold(event, branch.roster, branch.thresholds)

    # 6. State + role consumption
    if event carries roster: accumulate_delta(branch, event.roster); recheck_bounds(branch)
    if event.kind in {Ath, Rev, Dth}:  record delegates / kills for the delegation + rescission surface
    if event.kind == Wit:              read_wit_payload(event, root_facet)   # facet-correct allowlist
```

The verifier checks the **manifest role vocabulary** here — a manifest carrying any role outside the
kind's (facet-aware) allowlist is malformed and rejected — and **anchor format** (each `anchors`
entry a SAID-shaped token). Anchor **kind** and **tier** validation of the SEL events an IEL anchors
are downstream (the SEL verifier enforces them when resolving against IEL anchors); the IEL
verifier's own anchor resolution is **downward** — to the member KEL participations that authorize
the event.

### Root-facet dispatch

An IEL's inception fixes its **root facet** — `Icp`-rooted (a user identity) or `Fcp`-rooted (a
federation) — for the whole chain. At `serial = 0` the verifier dispatches on the inception kind:

| Inception kind | Root facet | Verifier behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Icp`          | user       | Federation-bound (required — there is no direct mode): reads `{federation, federationPin}` and the `witnesses` config; pins the initial roster + threshold vector; anchored by all initial members' KEL `Rot`s (each consenting). An `Icp` omitting the binding is rejected.                                                       |
| `Fcp`          | federation | The restricted facet: pins the witness-KEL roster, the `witnesses` config, and the `clock`; declares `{ govern, authorize }` (`authorize` only for block `Ath` / `Dth`); anchored kind-strict by each founder's KEL `Rot`. Recognizes a federation IEL from its own data — interpretation, not trust (the config-pin roots trust). |

The kind discriminator is structural — encoded in the chain data — so the verifier dispatches from
chain data alone. **The root facet is established before any `Wit` payload is read**, on **every**
`Wit`-reading path (the from-scratch walk, a `resume` from a cached token, and a `search_only` walk
that ends early). A `Wit` on an `Icp`-rooted chain may carry `{federation, federationPin}` +
`witnesses` and **must not** carry `roster` / `clock`; a `Wit` on an `Fcp`-rooted chain may carry
`roster` / `clock` / `witnesses` and **must not** carry `{federation, federationPin}`. The token
carries `root_facet` (set at inception) so a `resume` re-applies the dispatch without re-deriving it
— a `resume` can never process a `Wit` payload facet-blind. A facet-blind allowlist would admit a
governance-shaped roster delta on a user `Wit`, and since the kind → role allowlist is the **only**
gate on the directly-consumed governance roles, **the facet is established on every `Wit`-reading
path without exception**
([`merge.md` §Facet dispatch](merge.md#facet-dispatch-on-every-wit-reading-path)).

## Threshold anchoring — fresh participation up, `pins` down

An IEL event has no key of its own; its authority is a threshold of members' **fresh KEL
participations**. The verifier resolves and counts them:

- **Resolve the anchors down.** For each IEL event, find the member KEL events whose
  `manifest.anchors` names it. Each participation must be of **exactly** the kind that reveals the
  capability the act exercises (kind-strict up): content ← KEL `Ixn`; a tier-2 governance / kill /
  terminal act ← KEL `Rot`; the IEL `Wit` ← KEL `Wit`. A higher-tier stand-in does not count, and a
  rotated-out key cannot produce a fresh participation (closing the rotated-out-member backdate).
- **Verify each participation.** Each anchoring KEL is itself verified (its signature against the
  KEL's key state, its tier); only a KEL event that is **witnessed** on its own canonical branch
  counts toward threshold ([§Federation witnessing](#federation-witnessing-in-verification)).
- **Count against the kind's slot.** `Ixn` ← `t_use`; `Evl` / `Rev` / `Wit` / `Trm` ← `t_govern`;
  `Ath` / `Dth` ← `t_authorize`. An `Evl` **add** additionally requires each added member's tier-1
  KEL `Ixn` consent, counted toward consent-of-added, never `t_govern` — the kind split (joiner
  `Ixn` versus approver `Rot`) keeps it out of the governance count.

The IEL event records the members' prior KEL tips (`participation.previous`) in the top-level
`pins`-SAD; the verifier reads `pins` to locate each participation's chain without fetching the
manifest, and the fact that `pins` is top-level is what keeps the IEL's `said` independent of the
anchoring events (no SAID cycle).

### Roster accumulation — a delta, not a snapshot

The current roster and threshold vector are **not** stored as a snapshot; the verifier **accumulates
every delta while walking**. The `Icp` (or federation `Fcp`) pins the initial roster and the
declared threshold set; each `Evl` (user) or governance `Wit` (federation) carries a `roster` delta
(`add` + `cut` + changed thresholds), and the live roster is the running accumulation — a `cut`
`Evl` also evicts. The roster is a **set** (a delta is well-formed only with `add ∉ roster`,
`cut ⊆ roster`, `cut ∩ add = ∅`), and the verifier **re-checks the bounds on the post-delta config
at every config-changing event** — the security floor, the recoverability ceiling, the authorization
floor, the live-set cap of `MAXIMUM_ROSTER_SIZE`, and the non-empty floor. A delta pushing the live
set past `MAXIMUM_ROSTER_SIZE` is rejected (a DoS backstop). A `cut` is priced the **outgoing**
`t_govern` (the pre-change gate). This is why the token exposes the roster **as of a queried
position** — the accumulation up to that point, not a stored value.

## The bounded delegation walk

The `Ath` `delegates` role and the `Dth` `kills[]` rescission are the delegate surface (the full
doctrine is [`delegation.md`](delegation.md)). Answering "is party `P` a live delegate of `X`,
within `N` hops?" is a **bounded per-candidate walk**, never a materialization of the delegated set:

- **Never materialize the cumulative delegated set** — `X`'s transitive delegate closure is
  unbounded. The verifier streams `X`'s IEL with the candidate(s) in scope and carries **bounded
  per-candidate scalar state** (each candidate's `Ath` inclusion sets a boolean true), returning
  scalars. State is O(candidates), never the full set.
- **Walk up from the presented party, not down from `X`.** The verifier follows the **one
  authorizing path the document commits in its `delegationPath` field** — each hop a self-recorded
  `delegating` link chaining up toward `X` — confirming each hop's grant against that delegator's
  `Ath` inclusion list (a positive lookup). **Depth is the only quantity the walk adds.** Walking
  _up_ one committed path never enumerates the delegate tree beneath `X` — that tree **fans out** by
  design: a delegation hierarchy is how authority scales and how key management distributes across
  layers, so `X` need not authorize every actor directly. Each hop is a single `Ath`-inclusion
  lookup (itself bounded by `MAXIMUM_MANIFEST_LIST`) and its IEL verification is the ordinary
  per-IEL cost — no delegation-specific fan-out. The walk is bounded by the per-policy depth `N`
  **and** by a fixed protocol-wide **`MAXIMUM_DELEGATION_DEPTH = 8`** backstop; exceeding **either**
  denies (fail-secure). Eight leaves generous room — a real org hierarchy several layers deep (root
  → company → division → region → branch → team → individual) **and** person-to-person chains that
  reach across a well-connected planet (the six-degrees intuition, with headroom) — while the walk
  stays a cheap linear climb: each hop is one bounded `Ath`-inclusion lookup with no fan-out, so
  depth is the only quantity it adds. A per-policy `N` sits tighter underneath. A power of two, like
  most other protocol constants, and fixed — not a per-deployment knob.
- **Each hop's liveness is a `kills[]` forward-match** (below), never a scan for the absence of a
  rescission.

## The `kills[]` forward-match

Rescission (a delegate deauthorized, an owned artifact revoked) is answered by a **positive match**
on the owner's fresh IEL, never by scanning for absence. Given a killed locus, the verifier reads
**O(1) first, with a fail-secure fall-through**:

- **O(1) content-addressed read — first.** Read the derived lookup-SEL (its address is recomputed
  from `(authority, topic, data)`; the `Icp` is recomputed locally, never served, and only the `Trm`
  (+ receipts) is fetched): **present → killed**. Tamper-evident and authoritative — and `Trm.pin`
  (= the killing `Rev` / `Dth`'s `previous`) points straight at that kill event, so a grandfather
  check reads the `bound` from its `kills[]` entry directly, with no exhaustive `kills[]` scan of
  the chain.
- **On a miss, fail-secure by default** — compute the flat domain-qualified
  `target = hash('{tag}:{declarer}:{data}')` (the target **mirrors the killed address**:
  **non-lineaged** for a monotone kill, **lineaged** (`…:{lineage}`) for a **value rescission**,
  `:content` for a **content (app-SEL) closure** —
  [`sel/log.md`](../sel/log.md#the-content-and-lineage-fields)) and walk the owner's **fresh** IEL
  (from the relevant grant / issuance position to the tip), forward-matching the `target` against
  each `Rev` / `Dth`'s `kills[]`. In some `kills[]` → killed (grandfathered to that entry's
  `bound`); in none **on a walk that reached the fresh witnessed tip** → not killed. Being in a
  `kills[]` **is** the definition of killed, and it rides the same witnessed-IEL freshness gate as
  divergence, so a hidden kill needs a stale IEL the verifier already refuses when it trusts the
  owner at all. When it cannot freshness-confirm — any eclipse / single-source, **or a walk
  truncated at `max_pages` before the fresh witnessed tip** — it **refuses**, never reports
  not-killed.
- **Fail-open opts out of the walk** — under a latency budget a verifier may **opt down** to
  trusting the miss (best-effort not-killed), **never up**.

The `target` is **opaque to the IEL** — the verifier computes and matches it but never dereferences
it or interprets a `bound` (all revocation / grandfather logic is the feature layer's). A
**delegate**'s `bound` rides publicly in the `kills[].bound` field; a participant-identifying
`bound` — a **doc-member** grandfather cutoff or a **chat-membership** per-lane bound — has
`kills[]` carry only the blind `target`, and the verifier fetches the `bound` from the **SEL `Trm`'s
gated `bound` role** (a rescind-doc behind the read gate; withheld → conservative, don't honor). See
[§Negative checks are positive lookups](../../../../protocol-doctrine.md#negative-checks-are-positive-lookups).

## `IelVerification` token

`IelVerifier::into_verification()` produces an `IelVerification` token — the proof-of-verification
type (in the field shapes below, `Vec<T>` is a list, `Option<T>` an optional value, and
`BTreeSet<T>` a sorted set):

```
IelVerification:
    prefix: String
    root_facet: RootFacet                  # Icp-rooted (user identity) vs Fcp-rooted (federation); fixed at inception, carried so a resume reads Wit payloads facet-correctly (never facet-blind)
    roster_at_tip: RosterState             # the accumulated live roster + threshold vector at the canonical tip (a delta accumulation, not a stored snapshot)
    branch_tips: Vec<BranchTip>            # one per branch (1 = linear, >1 = divergent)
    divergence_ancestor: Option<SAID>      # SAID of v_{d-1} at the verdict's divergence (Forked: the first divergence; Disputed: the earliest carrying >= 2 accepted sealed branches — not a recovery point there); None on linear
    last_seal_advancing_event: Option<SAID>  # the derived seal: most recent sealing event with no competing accepted sealed branch from the divergence onward (a content sibling is buried below it; >= 2 accepted sealed branches -> no clean seal above the divergence)
    federation_context_per_event: ...      # per-event federation binding, from the IEL's own Icp / Wit (user); a federation IEL carries none
    anchored_saids: BTreeSet<SAID>         # SEL-event SAIDs and custody-anchored SAD issuance commitments (a credential is one use) found anchored on the canonical branch
    delegates_of: ...                      # per-candidate delegation-walk results (bounded scalar state)
    kills_matched: ...                     # kills[] forward-match results for the loci the caller registered
    structurally_valid: bool               # the structural-validity result (threshold anchoring, linkage, roster bounds)
    competing_branch_saids: Vec<SAID>      # the branch tips of a detected divergence (the beacon enumerates these)
    witnessed: bool                        # threshold-many federation receipts under consistent state (the IEL's own witness-config)
    witnessed_anchors: BTreeSet<SAID>      # subset of anchored SAIDs witnessed on the canonical branch

BranchTip:
    tip: IelEvent                          # chain head (latest event on this branch)
    roster_at_tip: RosterState             # the accumulated roster + thresholds on this branch
```

Token fields are private with no public constructor — the only way to obtain one is through
`IelVerifier`. Holding the token proves the corresponding chain was verified — so a trust decision,
and any resumption toward one, is grounded **only** in a token, never a bare `BranchTip` (a
read-only component of the token, not an independent verified state). The seal tracking is per
[`log.md` §The seal](log.md#the-seal-the-spine-and-the-locked-portion-bound).

### Derived accessors

- `roster_and_thresholds_at(position)` → the accumulated live roster + threshold vector as of a
  position (the delta accumulation up to it), for an `id(X)` policy leaf resolving `X`'s members and
  quorum.
- `is_delegate(candidate, N)` → the bounded delegation-walk result (live, within `N` hops).
- `is_killed(locus)` → the `kills[]` forward-match result (fail-secure by default).
- `is_terminated()` → `true` when the linear branch tip is a `Trm` (the identity retired; all its
  SELs freeze).
- `is_divergent()` → `branch_tips.len() > 1`.
- `region()` → the consumer-facing trust region computed **data-locally** against the **derived
  seal**: **trusted** (no fork reaching at-or-above the seal), **forked** (a content-only fork
  at-or-above the seal, both siblings accepted — no accepted sealed branch — recovers via a burying
  seal that buries the content → Active; a **single** accepted sealed branch buries the content and
  reads **trusted** — a reserve-theft takeover you did not author is clean on-chain, caught by
  owner-vigilance and answered by reincept out-of-band, not surfaced here), or **disputed** (two or
  more branches each carry an **accepted** (witnessed-at-threshold) sealed event — per branch,
  wherever the seal sits — terminal, reincept).
- `effective_said()` → a fingerprint of the node's held state: a **single confirmed tip yields that
  tip's SAID** (the `Trm` SAID when terminated); a chain with **no single tip** yields a
  **type-tagged synthetic recoupled to the verdict** (`forked` / `disputed`), qualified by prefix
  and position, **not** a digest over the competing tips (that set is adversarially extensible →
  flood-unstable). A settled content branch drops out (forensic, reached by a by-prefix flat fetch);
  a **below-seal** sealed straggler drops out too (dropped, inert — backdate-safe). Only a
  **witnessed** sealed fork — **≥ 2 accepted sealed branches**, wherever their seals sit — keeps the
  chain in the synthetic (`disputed`). See
  [§Effective-SAID comparison](../../../../protocol-doctrine.md#effective-said-comparison).
- `roster(tip_said)` → the **membership at a specific tip**: the roster + thresholds the verifier
  forked per branch (above), or **`Terminated`** when that tip is a `Trm`. Termination is an
  **implicit cut** of the whole membership — the `Trm` is validated against the roster it inherited,
  and nothing past it can meet any threshold — so it is a distinct resolution, **not** a size-0
  roster. This is the roster **twin of `effective_said`**: the roster-projection of the same walk.
- `roster()` → the **single** membership when there is one — a `Roster` on a chain with one
  authoritative (seal-bearing) roster (**Active**, or **Forked** — a content fork leaves key-state
  untouched, and a witness-declined sealed straggler never counts, so the **last-sealed** roster
  stays authoritative), or **`Terminated`**. It **errors on `Disputed`** (≥ 2 competing key-state
  rosters; the caller must name a tip via `roster(tip_said)`, and the error surfaces the competing
  tips). **Live authority is tiered — T1 live vs T2 sealed.** A live **T1 action** — a `t_use`
  ownership proof or content origination (`Ixn`) — is **frozen on any divergence**: it resolves only
  when the chain is **Active**, so a **forked, disputed, or terminated** identity exercises no live
  T1 authority (the forked tier itself is the one in doubt). Any **non-terminal T2 sealed act** —
  `Evl` / `Ath` / `Rev` / `Dth` / `Wit`, each at its own threshold (`t_authorize` or `t_govern`) —
  **seals**: it resolves against `roster()` and advances the seal, burying a content fork below it,
  so **any such act is a way out of a fork** (a forked identity **seals** its way back to
  **Active**); a **`Trm`** (also T2) buries the content but the chain goes **Terminated**. This is
  sound because what a seal-out **buries** is the **T1 content loser**: a content fork's competing
  branches are T1-authored and no T1 actor holds any **T2** quorum, so allowing T2 to seal out only
  ever hands recovery to legitimate higher authority (the sealed branch of a mixed `{Evl, content}`
  fork is itself a legitimate T2 act, not a thing being overturned); it proceeds wherever there is
  one authoritative roster (**Active or Forked**), while a **disputed** (no single roster →
  reincept) or **terminated** identity cannot. **Burial is not eviction:** any T2 seal buries the
  current content loser, but an **adversarial, re-forking** causer is neutralized only by an `Evl` +
  `cut` (`t_govern`) that evicts it — an IEL seal rotates no key, so a benign gossip-lag fork needs
  only a seal while an adversarial one needs the cut. **Grants are not overturned** — `Ath` seals a
  grant permanently, `Dth` rescinds **forward**, never retroactively. The rule: **on a fork, freeze
  T1 actions; seal your way out with any T2 act (evict with `Evl` + `cut` if the causer re-forks).**
  **As-issued** authority reads the roster at the historical anchoring position (single-tipped in
  the past) and is untouched by the current tip's state.

The chain **states**, the `region()` trust projection, and the `effective_said` type tags are three
views of the one data-local walk:

| chain state | `region()` | `effective_said`     | `roster()`                    | T1 action (`t_use`) · T2 seal (`t_authorize`/`t_govern`) |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Active      | `trusted`  | real tip SAID        | the roster                    | ✓ · ✓                                                    |
| Forked      | `forked`   | `forked` synthetic   | the roster (frozen)           | ✗ · ✓ (seal out of the fork)                             |
| Disputed    | `disputed` | `disputed` synthetic | `Err` — per-tip `roster(tip)` | ✗ · ✗ (reincept)                                         |
| Terminated  | `trusted`  | real `Trm` SAID      | `Terminated`                  | ✗ · ✗ (retired)                                          |

`region()` is the **divergence** axis, so Active and Terminated both project to `trusted`;
termination rides the orthogonal `is_terminated()` accessor, and `roster()` is the **membership**
axis — a third projection of the one walk, where Terminated resolves to no roster and Disputed to
one roster per competing tip. A live-act gate reads them together: a **`t_use` (T1) action**
proceeds only at **Active**; **any T2 sealed act** (`t_authorize` or `t_govern`) proceeds wherever
`roster()` yields a single `Roster` — **Active or Forked** — so a forked identity **seals its way
out**, while a dispute (reincept) and termination refuse.

## Inline anchor checking

The caller registers SAIDs of interest before the walk via `verifier.check_anchors(saids)`. As the
verifier processes events, it checks each event's `manifest.anchors` against the registered SAIDs —
the `anchors` role lives on `Ixn` (SEL v1s + credential issuance commitments), `Evl` (a `Sea`),
`Ath` (a `Gnt`), and `Rev` / `Dth` (a `Trm`). Results are on the token via `is_said_anchored()` /
`anchors_all_saids()`. The token surfaces the **anchoring IEL event's kind** on each matched anchor,
so a cross-chain consumer (the SEL verifier) can enforce the kind-strict anchor matrix
([`events.md` §The kind-strict anchor matrix](events.md#the-kind-strict-anchor-matrix)).
Registration before the walk lets the verifier record observations without a second database pass —
the uniform verification-token pattern
([§Operation categories — consuming](../../../../protocol-doctrine.md#operation-categories)).

## Divergence detection and terminal-state determination

Verification surfaces divergence as a **structural condition** on the token — it reads through the
pathology to expose the chain's final portion rather than hard-failing. The verifier forks
per-branch state (roster and thresholds forked too) when a second distinct event appears at a
serial, records the divergence ancestor and the competing branch tips, verifies each branch
independently, and surfaces `is_divergent()` and `region()`.

### Terminal-state determination rule

- A **live** fork — a divergence at or above the **derived seal**?
  - **No accepted sealed branch** (a content-only fork, both siblings accepted) → **forked**
    (recoverable); a burying seal buries the content → Active. A **single** accepted sealed branch
    buries the content → **Active**, not forked.
  - **Two or more _accepted_ (witnessed-at-threshold) sealed branches** (per branch, wherever their
    seals sit) → **disputed**; reincept.
- No live fork — linear, or a fork **buried below the seal** (its content loser inert) → **Active**
  (or Terminated via `Trm`); a `{Trm, content}` fork ends **Terminated** by tier-rank.

A `{Rev, content}` or `{Evl, content}` fork is one accepted sealed branch → **Active** (the sealed
branch buries the content sibling; a `{Trm, content}` reads **Terminated**). A `{Evl, Evl}` (or any
two accepted sealed branches — the federation IEL's every conflict) → **disputed**.

### Verifier reports; the merge layer gates

> **Verifier-merge composition.** The verifier itself does not reject submissions — it records the
> **structural-validity result** (`structurally_valid`) and the anchoring / divergence / roster
> signals on the token. The merge layer rejects candidate batches whose post-walk token reports a
> structural failure; the new events never land. See
> [§Structural problems error; everything else is reported](../../../../protocol-doctrine.md#structural-problems-error-everything-else-is-reported).

Hard-fail at the verifier is reserved for structural-integrity violations: SAID / prefix mismatch,
broken chain linkage, a threshold-unmet or signature-invalid anchor, a role outside the
(facet-aware) allowlist, a `kills` on an `Ixn`, a post-delta roster-bound violation, tamper. Chain
validity stays separable from the answer a consumer wants — the verifier reads through pathology to
expose the at-or-below-seal portion even on a chain with above-seal divergence; the merge layer
reads `structurally_valid` to gate against it.

### Pre-seal verifiability on the token

The trust an anchor carries splits at the **seal**, not the divergence point. An anchor hosted
at-or-below `last_seal_advancing_event` — a credential issued under a below-seal roster state, a SEL
bound at a below-seal `Ixn` — is **permanently final**, regardless of any later above-seal
divergence. (Against a **witnessed** sealed fork — **≥ 2 accepted sealed branches**, wherever their
seals sit — the reading flips to `disputed` and the clean seal retreats to the divergence ancestor,
so permanence runs against that retreated clean seal; a below-seal sealed straggler is **dropped**,
not disputed.) So `anchored_saids` reflects the canonical branch, and a consumer composes the
anchor's seal position with `region()`: a below-seal anchor is honored even on a `disputed` chain —
for as-issued finality and existing bindings; granting **new** current trust still gates on
`region()` — while an above-seal anchor on a `disputed` chain grounds no new trust.

## Federation witnessing in verification

The verifier surfaces federation-witnessing signals on the token. Full mechanics live in
[`../../../../substrate/federation/witnessing.md`](../../../../substrate/federation/witnessing.md);
this section names what the IEL verifier reads. **The data decides; witnessing propagates** —
receipts deliver competing branches and freshness, never a verdict.

- **`witnessed`.** An IEL event has **no key of its own**, so its witnessing **is** the witnessing
  of its **member KEL anchors** — the event is trusted when the required threshold of its anchoring
  member KEL participations are witnessed (the IEL's own `witnesses` config sets `threshold` /
  `signers`). A **user** IEL adds a second gate for **fork prevention** — the **position gate**: its
  events — content _and_ sealed — must also reach a **witness majority at their own
  `(IEL prefix, serial)`** (the position gate is **universal**), so two disjoint member sub-quorums
  cannot both land an event at one IEL serial, and a competing sealed sibling is declined
  first-seen. The **federation** IEL **realizes the position gate through exclude-self
  peer-witnessing** — its witnesses witness each other **exclude-self**, so a governance event needs
  a peer majority first-seen at its serial.
- **The divergence signal splits by provenance.** When a node holds two or more sealed branches
  **each accepted** — witnessed at threshold **and** its lineage accepted (a branch off a first-seen
  loss is dead on ascent and never counts) — at the **last seal**, it reads **`disputed` directly**
  — the walk decides. A sealed sibling held only as a **receipt** (not yet fetched), one **below
  threshold** (witness-declined), or one **below the seal** (dropped, backdate-safe) is not counted
  — it stays **`forked`** / deferred-pending. For content, a losing sibling never reaches threshold
  under the position gate, so the signal is a sub-threshold competing receipt set — the node fetches
  the event and the data-local walk decides.
- **`witnessed_anchors`.** The subset of the IEL's own anchored SEL SAIDs witnessed on the canonical
  branch; the SEL verifier consults it during kind-strict anchor authorization — only witnessed
  anchors count.

### Federation context per layer

Federation context attaches **per layer**. A **user IEL records its own** authoritative
`{federation, federationPin}` on its `Icp` / `Wit`, **field-matched** to its members' KEL `Wit`s on
every walk — it does **not** adopt a single member's KEL binding, so a lone or desynced member
cannot straddle the identity onto a different federation. A **federation IEL** carries **no**
federation field (it _is_ the federation, never self-bound — the `federationPin` currency gate does
not apply to it; its freshness is its clock). A **SEL** inherits its owner IEL's binding. The token
surfaces `federation_context_per_event` so a cross-chain verifier resolves each event to its
federation for witnessing while reading the binding from the layer that owns it. Trust composes
through the config-pinned federation prefix set (runtime-configured, empty by default — fail-secure)
— a federation is trusted iff its prefix is in that set; multi-federation chains require each
federation independently trusted (no transitive trust). See
[§Federation witnessing in verification](../../../../protocol-doctrine.md#federation-witnessing-in-verification).

## Streaming

IEL verification follows the cross-primitive streaming pattern — the verifier walks page by page
rather than loading the full chain into memory, accumulating the roster as it goes.

### Constructors

- **`IelVerifier::new(prefix)`** — start from inception; full verification of an untrusted chain.
- **`IelVerifier::resume(prefix, &IelVerification, branch_tip_said?)`** — resume from a verified
  token — **the only way to resume**, since only a token proves a walk happened (a `BranchTip` is a
  read-only component of the token, never an independent resume source). With `branch_tip_said`
  **absent** it resumes the whole chain (the merge handler's normal-append fast path); with it
  **naming one of the token's own branch tips** it scopes verification to that single branch
  (divergence / recovery — the input stream is only that branch's events; the competing branches sit
  excluded in retained storage). Either way it re-applies the token's `root_facet` so a `Wit` is
  never read facet-blind, and re-runs the to-tip negative checks (the `kills[]` forward-match)
  against the new tip whenever a transitively-pinned chain moves
  ([§Walk semantics](../../../../protocol-doctrine.md#walk-semantics)).

### Paginated verification helper

`completed_verification(loader, prefix, page_size, max_pages, anchors)` pages through a
`PageLoader`, calling `truncate_incomplete_generation()` at page boundaries so a divergent
generation spanning two pages re-fetches rather than being processed half-observed. Returns a
trusted `IelVerification`. `max_pages` prevents resource exhaustion (default 64 pages ≈ 8K events;
configurable).

## Per-event check summary

| Property                        | Verification method                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SAID / prefix integrity         | Re-derive from canonical bytes with the placeholder; compare to declared (inception re-derives the prefix from roster + thresholds + `nonce`).                                                    |
| Event chaining                  | `previous` resolves to a verified prior event; each sealing event's `previousSeal` resolves to the prior seal.                                                                                    |
| Serial monotonicity             | Each event's serial equals the previous serial + 1; inception is serial 0.                                                                                                                        |
| Inception kind + facet dispatch | Branch on `Icp` / `Fcp`; fix `root_facet`; read `Wit` payloads facet-correctly on every path.                                                                                                     |
| Threshold authority             | A threshold of members' fresh KEL participations (kind-strict up) anchor the event; each anchoring KEL signature valid and witnessed.                                                             |
| Roster accumulation + bounds    | Accumulate every `add` / `cut` / threshold delta; re-check the post-delta bounds (security floor, recoverability ceiling, authorization floor, cap `MAXIMUM_ROSTER_SIZE`) at every config change. |
| Manifest roles + anchor format  | The `manifest` carries only roles in the kind's facet-aware allowlist; each `anchors` entry a valid SAID-shaped token.                                                                            |
| Delegation / rescission         | Bounded per-candidate delegation walk; `kills[]` forward-match (fail-secure by default).                                                                                                          |
| Federation context              | Records the IEL's own binding per event (user); a federation IEL carries none.                                                                                                                    |
| Witness state                   | Token surfaces `witnessed` (member-anchor witnessing; a user IEL's own position gate), the divergence signal, `witnessed_anchors`.                                                                |
