# VDTI Design Documentation

This directory is the **design surface** for VDTI — the canonical specification of the protocol. It
is built from foundations up: each layer builds on the ones below it. Read it in order for a first
full pass, or jump to a layer with the table of contents.

Two ideas anchor everything here. Every content-bearing object is a **SAD** — Self-Addressed Data, a
record identified by the hash of its own content. And the system's central claim is
**end-verifiability**: any consumer can validate any chain, credential, or event from the data
alone, trusting no service, database, or peer. The reading order follows from that — the data
substrate first, then the doctrine that governs it, then the primitives that implement it, then the
authorization and protocol layers that sit on top.

## What you never have to worry about

Building on VDTI is meant to feel different in a specific way: whole categories of bug do not exist
in the world you are composing — not because you were careful, but because the substrate makes them
unrepresentable. You wire the primitives together; the classes of error below are ones you never
have to defend against.

**No bad state to clean up** — _your data cannot rot._

- **No bad data, no migrations.** Data verifies or it is rejected at the door. There is no corrupt
  state that got persisted and now needs a repair script, no schema backfill, no "fix everything"
  fire drill.
- **No broken links.** A reference commits to exact content by hash, and anchors are append-only — a
  link cannot dangle, break, or silently repoint. The whole referential-integrity category is gone.

**Nothing to trust** — _you verify instead._

- **No trust decisions.** Every object proves itself from its own bytes. A hostile server, a stale
  cache, or a tampered database cannot fool a verifier — so "which copy is authoritative" and "can I
  trust this source" are never questions you are asked.
- **The data is the audit trail.** The chain is append-only and tamper-evident; there is no separate
  log to keep in sync, and no way for what happened to disagree with what is recorded.

**No split-brain to reconcile** — _distributed, without the distributed-systems tax._

- **No silent divergence.** Conflicting writes are either prevented or surfaced explicitly as forked
  or disputed — you never act on two disagreeing "current" values, and you never hand-write merge or
  conflict-resolution logic.
- **No clock to trust.** Ordering — which event came first — comes from position on the chain, not
  wall-clock time, so clock skew, NTP drift, and lying timestamps cannot decide authority or order.

**Authority cannot go stale** — _permission is correct across time._

- **No point-in-time authorization bugs.** "Was this allowed when it happened?" is answered for you
  by append-only position; nobody can backdate a permission, and you never hand-roll the check.
- **Kills and rotations just propagate.** A revoked thing reads dead by default — and a withheld
  revocation cannot hide behind a stale view; a rotated key or a swapped device never breaks
  anything downstream, because you reference identities, not keys.

## The layer stack

VDTI is built bottom-up: each layer rests on the ones below it. The map below is the reading order
as a picture — start at the bottom and build up.

Two edges are worth calling out. **Doctrine (2) cross-cuts** — its rules constrain every layer
above, not only the one directly over it. And the **event-log primitives (3) and federation (4) are
co-foundational**: a federation is itself a restricted identity event log (IEL), so it is built
_from_ the event-log primitives — yet federation witnessing is what makes those logs sound, since a
fork cannot silently form on a witnessed chain. Everything above them — policy, the protocol
primitives, and the features — rests on that **verified layer**. (Each solid edge runs from a layer
up to the one that builds on it; dotted edges are orientation and the cross-cut.)

## 0 — Orientation

Start here.

1. [`system-thesis.md`](system-thesis.md) — the founding thesis: end-verifiability over data from
   any source, the adversarial-first posture, and the load-bearing doctrines (compromise is
   permanent, divergence resolves by tier, forks are seal-bounded, the verifier is the trust
   boundary). The "why" behind every rule that follows.

Keep [`glossary.md`](glossary.md) open alongside — it gives a one-line definition of every
load-bearing term (seal, tier, sealed branch, effective-SAID, …) with a pointer to the doc that owns
it. For going straight to a section rather than reading in order, [`TOC.md`](TOC.md) links every
file and its top-level sections.

## 1 — The data substrate

Everything content-bearing is a SAD; this layer defines what that means. (This group also carries
its own reading-order note in `sad.md`.)

2. [`primitives/data/sad/sad.md`](primitives/data/sad/sad.md) — the SAD record: chain events versus
   standalone SADs, composition by reference.
3. [`primitives/data/sad/said.md`](primitives/data/sad/said.md) — the SAID derivation and
   canonicalization — the mechanism that makes end-verifiability work.
4. [`primitives/data/sad/custody.md`](primitives/data/sad/custody.md) — per-object authority: who
   may write, who may read.
5. [`primitives/data/sad/availability.md`](primitives/data/sad/availability.md) — where the bytes
   live: replicas, expiry, one-shot delivery.
6. [`primitives/data/sad/compaction.md`](primitives/data/sad/compaction.md) — compaction and
   selective disclosure.

Building on all of these, [`primitives/data/sad/rooting.md`](primitives/data/sad/rooting.md) states
how the SAD store decides a submitted SAD belongs — the **rooting** admission rule that turns spam
resistance from an operator knob into a structural floor (paired with a federation's
[prefix block](substrate/federation/blocking.md) against a valid-identity flood).

Alongside these, three **identifier catalogues** define the naming conventions used surface-wide
(all on the shared `vdti/{component}/v1/{category}/{name}` convention) — read one when a `kind`,
`tag`, or `topic` first puzzles you: [`primitives/data/sad/kinds.md`](primitives/data/sad/kinds.md)
(every SAD `kind`, with each kind's field shape in
[`primitives/data/sad/shapes.md`](primitives/data/sad/shapes.md)),
[`primitives/data/event-logs/tags-and-topics.md`](primitives/data/event-logs/tags-and-topics.md)
(the derivation `tag`s and SEL `topic`s), and
[`substrate/federation/topics.md`](substrate/federation/topics.md) (the gossip topics, also at #28).

## 2 — Cross-cutting doctrine

7. [`protocol-doctrine.md`](protocol-doctrine.md) — the rules that span every primitive: the two
   capability tiers, the seal and locked-portion bound, divergence and recovery, federation
   convergence, the verification walk, and the shared terminology. Dense; read it here for the
   concept map, and revisit its divergence and federation sections after the event-log group — they
   land deeper once the event shapes are concrete.

Alongside the doctrine, [`residuals.md`](residuals.md) is the honest-limits catalog — every risk the
design does not fully eliminate, ranked by severity (bounded by the property at risk), each with the
concrete attack, the mitigation, and what is lost. It is where a deployment learns what each trade
costs and what the whole system leans on. [`monitoring.md`](monitoring.md) covers the owner-side
detection layer for the silent compromises — comparing a prefix's effective SAID against what its
key state expects.

## 3 — The event-log primitives

The KEL / IEL / SEL chains — the heart of the protocol.

8. [`primitives/data/event-logs/event-shape.md`](primitives/data/event-logs/event-shape.md) — the
   event taxonomy, field shape, and per-kind structural rules shared across all three log types. The
   bridge from SADs to chains.

Then the KEL (Key Event Log) primitive, in order:

9. [`primitives/data/event-logs/kel/log.md`](primitives/data/event-logs/kel/log.md) — the chain
   primitive: the four-state per-node machine, the seal / spine / locked-portion, paging.
10. [`primitives/data/event-logs/kel/events.md`](primitives/data/event-logs/kel/events.md) — the
    five-kind taxonomy (plus the founder `Fcp` inception variant), the two-tier capability model,
    the kind-strict anchor matrix, and forward-key commitments.
11. [`primitives/data/event-logs/kel/verification.md`](primitives/data/event-logs/kel/verification.md)
    — the verifier walk and the verification token: how a chain is read and validated.
12. [`primitives/data/event-logs/kel/merge.md`](primitives/data/event-logs/kel/merge.md) — the write
    path: divergence resolution, burial by position and ascent, and the single-word merge outcomes.
13. [`primitives/data/event-logs/kel/compromise.md`](primitives/data/event-logs/kel/compromise.md) —
    recovery as a plain burying `Rot`: the reserve defends the signing key, not the rotation key.
14. [`primitives/data/event-logs/kel/reconciliation.md`](primitives/data/event-logs/kel/reconciliation.md)
    — the exhaustive correctness proof: every divergence case resolved, and the argument that all
    honest nodes converge. The densest doc; read it last.

Then the IEL (Identity Event Log) primitive, in order:

15. [`primitives/data/event-logs/iel/log.md`](primitives/data/event-logs/iel/log.md) — the chain
    primitive: an identity as a threshold over member KELs; the four-state machine; the seal,
    locked-portion bound, and seal-cap over the content window versus the sealed spine.
16. [`primitives/data/event-logs/iel/events.md`](primitives/data/event-logs/iel/events.md) — the
    eight-kind taxonomy (plus the restricted federation set), the threshold vector and its bounds,
    the kind-strict anchor matrix, the `kills[]` revocation declaration, and the facet-dependent
    `Wit`.
17. [`primitives/data/event-logs/iel/verification.md`](primitives/data/event-logs/iel/verification.md)
    — the verifier walk: threshold anchoring, roster accumulation by delta, root-facet dispatch, and
    the `kills[]` forward-match.
18. [`primitives/data/event-logs/iel/merge.md`](primitives/data/event-logs/iel/merge.md) — the write
    path: events first-seen **per tier** at their own position (the universal position gate — one
    content, one sealed), sealed record-both, and eviction via a roster `cut`.
19. [`primitives/data/event-logs/iel/reconciliation.md`](primitives/data/event-logs/iel/reconciliation.md)
    — the correctness-proof matrix: the content-versus-sealed divergence enumeration and the verdict
    by witnessed-sealed-branch count (at the last seal).
20. [`primitives/data/event-logs/iel/delegation.md`](primitives/data/event-logs/iel/delegation.md) —
    the delegate / rescind surface: the single-hop grant-and-rescission primitive.

Then the SEL (SAD Event Log) primitive, in order:

21. [`primitives/data/event-logs/sel/log.md`](primitives/data/event-logs/sel/log.md) — the chain
    primitive: a single-owner data log that is its own witnessed chain; the four-state machine, the
    seal and its advancers, and the severance a dead owner-IEL anchor causes.
22. [`primitives/data/event-logs/sel/events.md`](primitives/data/event-logs/sel/events.md) — the
    six-kind taxonomy, the three axes, the kind-strict cross-layer anchor matrix, the typed-value
    `Gnt`, the neutral `Sea` re-seal, and the content and lineage fields.
23. [`primitives/data/event-logs/sel/verification.md`](primitives/data/event-logs/sel/verification.md)
    — the verifier walk: owner-rooting, the witnessed divergence read, the severance read, the
    `content: true` acceptance biconditional, and the value lineage walk.
24. [`primitives/data/event-logs/sel/merge.md`](primitives/data/event-logs/sel/merge.md) — the write
    path: witnessed first-seen, seal-advancer burial, and inherited severance.
25. [`primitives/data/event-logs/sel/reconciliation.md`](primitives/data/event-logs/sel/reconciliation.md)
    — the correctness proof: the SEL's own divergence crossed with inherited owner-IEL deadness.

## 4 — Federation and witnessing

The witnessing layer every KEL, IEL, and SEL rests on for its soundness. A federation is a
restricted IEL whose roster is witness KELs directly; witnessing is what prevents a content fork
from forming on an honest chain and makes a sealed fork detectable everywhere. This group also
carries [`substrate/federation/blocking.md`](substrate/federation/blocking.md) — the second front of
spam protection (with [rooting](primitives/data/sad/rooting.md)): a federation refusing to witness
an abusive prefix, a reversible, quorum-gated per-prefix block against a valid-identity flood.

26. [`substrate/federation/bootstrap.md`](substrate/federation/bootstrap.md) — genesis and the
    configured trust root: the restricted-IEL shape, the dependency-ordered ceremony, and why there
    is no self-witnessing carve-out.
27. [`substrate/federation/witnessing.md`](substrate/federation/witnessing.md) — the mechanism: the
    witnessing floor, first-seen (content prevention / sealed detection), fork-cost, deterministic
    selection, as-of-context receipts and the currency gate, the clock, the receipt SAD, rebinding,
    and the recoverability cap.
28. [`substrate/federation/topics.md`](substrate/federation/topics.md) — the gossip topics (the
    witness-mesh channels) and the two-scope encrypted transport.
29. [`substrate/infrastructure/mesh-transport.md`](substrate/infrastructure/mesh-transport.md) — the
    authenticated, encrypted channel the mesh runs over: handshake, per-connection session keys, and
    the nonce discipline that makes reuse structural.

## 5 — The document-authorization layer

Policy sits above the primitives — it governs documents, never the chain events themselves
(chain-event authorization is structural). (This group carries its own reading-order note in
`policy.md`.)

30. [`primitives/policy/policy.md`](primitives/policy/policy.md) — the policy language (`id` / `del`
    / `pol` / `crd` leaves; `thr` / `wgt` / `and` combinators).
31. [`primitives/policy/documents.md`](primitives/policy/documents.md) — the anchored issuer context
    a relying party's policy is matched against, and how a document anchors that context.
32. [`primitives/policy/evaluation.md`](primitives/policy/evaluation.md) — how a policy is evaluated
    (as-issued) and the seam to the primitives.

## 6 — The protocol primitives

These primitives sit atop the verified layer — the sealed envelope and the disclosure exchange that
credentials and secure messaging are built from, the device-key directory recipients are resolved
through, and the shared group key that chat and shared documents encrypt under. They compose the
primitives below rather than extending them.

33. [`primitives/protocols/essr.md`](primitives/protocols/essr.md) — the sealed, authenticated
    one-to-one envelope: confidential to the recipient, provably from the sender, and the two
    identity bindings that make it so.
34. [`primitives/protocols/ipex.md`](primitives/protocols/ipex.md) — the issuance and presentation
    exchange: every exchange a disclosure from a discloser to a disclosee, the anchor and compaction
    as its two proofs, and the single-round-trip freshness envelope that binds a presentation to one
    use.
35. [`primitives/protocols/receive-key-directory.md`](primitives/protocols/receive-key-directory.md)
    — the directory of an identity's device receive keys: how a key is published, and how a sender
    resolves one or fans out to all of a recipient's devices.
36. [`primitives/protocols/group-key.md`](primitives/protocols/group-key.md) — the ratcheting shared
    key a group encrypts under: per-device fan-out, epochs, and the ratchet, with chat and shared
    documents as its consumers.
37. [`primitives/protocols/membership.md`](primitives/protocols/membership.md) — the unbounded,
    per-requester gated set that authorizes one identity at a time (a chat's store gate, a shared
    document's read/write gate), never materialized as a roster.
38. [`primitives/protocols/authored-dag.md`](primitives/protocols/authored-dag.md) — the per-writer
    content graph a chat lane and a document version graph are: attribution by lane, monotone order,
    and a single-parent (fork = equivocation) / multi-parent (branch + merge) variant.

## 7 — The feature layer

Features compose the primitives into what an application ships: credentials, secure messaging (the
`exchange` feature), and shared documents.

39. [`features/credentials.md`](features/credentials.md) — issuing a credential and, the core case,
    a relying party accepting a presented one: the anchor and compaction as its proofs, the two
    questions (validly-issued, ownership), IPEX presentation, targeted-vs-bearer, blinded
    claim-gating, revocation, edges, terms-of-use, bulk issuance, and the migration-first registrar.
40. [`features/exchange.md`](features/exchange.md) — sealed store-and-forward messaging: the two
    modes (one-off ESSR mail and the ratcheting chat session), digest-named payloads, sender-key
    currency, recipient-scoped delivery + the serve-time gate, the `chat-membership` store gate, and
    the per-sender-lane authored DAG.
41. [`features/shared-documents.md`](features/shared-documents.md) — a document several parties
    co-author, membership and sharing evolving under a creator: the V0 constitution, the three
    `document-*-membership` instances (edit / comment / read, max-capability), the multi-parent
    version DAG, the honored-window predicate, and group-key confidentiality.

## 8 — The services layer

How the design deploys: the verification core as a library, two thin daemons over it, and the
consumer-side machinery that keeps trust decisions fresh without trusting any node.

42. [`substrate/infrastructure/architecture.md`](substrate/infrastructure/architecture.md) — the
    decomposition and its boundary rules: the core as the consumer-linked library, the transfer
    engine, the home-node consumer topology, the token store, and the freshness statement.
43. [`substrate/infrastructure/vdtid.md`](substrate/infrastructure/vdtid.md) — the chain-log and SAD
    store daemon: the API surface, the merge write path, the deferred-dependencies response, the
    SAD-store write path, and the enforced serve-by-SAID rule.
44. [`substrate/infrastructure/witnessd.md`](substrate/infrastructure/witnessd.md) — the witness,
    gossip, and sync daemon: key custody, the witness role and routing, freshness-statement service,
    deferred-dependency parking, and anti-entropy.

## 9 — Example applications

Validation by composition: each doc designs one application from the landed layers alone, citing
every mechanism it leans on and stating honestly where the composition's edges are. One application
per distinct feature/primitive combination; the set grows as the docs land.

45. [`example-applications/drive.md`](example-applications/drive.md) — file storage and sync from
    data with custody alone: the hash-tree drive, sharing as membership, and the honest edge that
    points at logs.
46. [`example-applications/ledger.md`](example-applications/ledger.md) — the append-only audit trail
    from a log alone: witnessed entries, disinterested timestamps, and the audit read as the
    ordinary walk.
47. [`example-applications/pds.md`](example-applications/pds.md) — the personal data store from
    custody plus logs: records as custodied SADs, indexes as owned chains, and the new-device
    recovery story.
48. [`example-applications/bbs.md`](example-applications/bbs.md) — the public message board from
    shared documents alone: posts as comments, moderation as rescission, and the wiki and code host
    absorbed by the version DAG.
49. [`example-applications/tracker.md`](example-applications/tracker.md) — the issue tracker from
    shared documents plus credentials: membership gates writing, credentials carry roles, and the
    application combines the proofs.
50. [`example-applications/sso.md`](example-applications/sso.md) — passwordless sign-in from
    identity plus credentials: the ownership proof as the login, attestation as a presented
    credential, no provider in the loop.
51. [`example-applications/permit.md`](example-applications/permit.md) — licensing and permits from
    credentials alone: the full lifecycle — issue, delegate, disclose, renew, revoke — and the
    largest absorbed family.
52. [`example-applications/iam.md`](example-applications/iam.md) — organizational access control
    from credentials plus the policy layer: grants as credentials, rules as committed policy SADs,
    every resource deciding locally with no authorization service.
53. [`example-applications/passport.md`](example-applications/passport.md) — the digital product
    passport from credentials plus a log: the maker's credential, the registry's dossier, and
    third-party attestations collected by reference.
54. [`example-applications/mail.md`](example-applications/mail.md) — sealed store-and-forward
    messaging from exchange alone: the one-off mode as an app, with notifications, file transfer,
    and key distribution absorbed.
55. [`example-applications/chat.md`](example-applications/chat.md) — the ratcheting group
    conversation: exchange's session mode, per-writer lanes, epochs, and membership churn from data
    alone.
56. [`example-applications/edit.md`](example-applications/edit.md) — the collaborative editor from
    shared documents plus exchange: the checkpoint split, confidential collaboration, and the
    sovereignty mode made usable.
57. [`example-applications/trace.md`](example-applications/trace.md) — track-and-trace provenance
    from credentials, logs, and exchange: per-actor legs, jointly attested hand-off records, no
    central tracker.
58. [`example-applications/trade.md`](example-applications/trade.md) — trade documents from all
    three features: issued instruments, the collaborative transaction file, sealed negotiation, and
    title as issuer re-grant.
59. [`example-applications/health.md`](example-applications/health.md) — patient-held records from
    credentials plus exchange: provider-signed records, selective disclosure, custody without losing
    provider assurance.
60. [`example-applications/registrar.md`](example-applications/registrar.md) — binding people to
    identities: the external-authority seam, migration-first enrollment, and the maintained
    one-person-one-prefix invariant.
61. [`example-applications/vote.md`](example-applications/vote.md) — auditable elections on the
    registrar: eligibility credentials, spend-on-cast, anchored ballots, and the recomputable tally
    — with the secret ballot scoped out honestly.
62. [`example-applications/issuer.md`](example-applications/issuer.md) — the issuing organization's
    console: kinds, minting, revocation, delegation, and published acceptance policies — the
    building block every other harness instantiates.

## Forthcoming

These are referenced above as forward-references and are still forthcoming:

- The **encoding library** — the byte-exact `select` scheme, receipt and freshness-statement
  canonicalization, and the AEAD nonce / key-scope discipline.
